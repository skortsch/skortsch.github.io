  I am a community and food web ecologist currently working as a University project researcher at Åbo Akademi University, Finland. In my current position, I will investigate the main drivers behind the structure of the Gulf of Riga food web, Baltic Sea. Further, I will be mentoring two PhD students in the field of food web ecology, Lucinda Kraufvelin and Patrik Ståhl.

  During my PhD, I was working with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raul-Primicerio"> Dr. Raul Primicerio </a> (UiT the Arctic University of Norway) where I was introduced to food web ecology. In my PhD I studied variation in food web structure along large-scale environmental gradients. Further I looked at ecological benthic community responses to climate warming.
     After my PhD I completed postdoctoral work with <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Dr. Marie Nordström </a> (Åbo Akademi, Finland). This work included linking temporal food web structure in the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Riga) to ecosystem functioning. I recently completed my second postdoctoral research position with <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/phamb-1.192363"> Dr. Tomas Roslin</a> 
  at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. During my postdoc at HI, I built a individual-based model to predict how the pollination process unfolds in a spatial context.

  Outside of research, I like to do outdoor activities depending on the season. I also love saunas and icy swims afterwards.
