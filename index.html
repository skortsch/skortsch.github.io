  I am a marine community and food web ecologist at University of Helsinki in Finland @Tvärminne Zoological Station. My work focuses on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and stability, 
    and the role that species interactions (trophic and non-trophic) play in maintaining species co-existence and persistence in complex ecological communities.

      
  I am part of the Centre for Coastal Ecosystem and Climate Change Research at University of Helsinki and Stockholm University which evaluates the links between coastal biodiversity, carbon cycling, and climate feedbacks
    For more information, please click <a href="www.coastclim.org"> the CoastClim site</a>. </p>  
 In CoastClim I am assessing the importance of biodiversity, and especially species interactions, for carbon cycling and turnover in coastal (Baltic Sea) ecosystems.

  During my PhD, I was working with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raul-Primicerio"> Dr. Raul Primicerio </a>  at UiT the Arctic University of Norway, where I was introduced to food web ecology and network analyses. In my PhD, I studied variation in marine food web structure along large-scale environmental gradients in the Barents Sea (sub-Arctic to Arctic region), with special emphasis on how biological responses to climate warming (e.g., poleward shifts) change food web structure and functioning. Further, I studied benthic community responses (regime shifts) to climate warming in Svalbard.
     After my PhD I completed postdoctoral work with <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Dr. Marie Nordström </a> (Åbo Akademi, Finland). This work included linking temporal food web structure in the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Riga) to ecosystem functioning using bioenergtic food web modelling. I completed my second postdoctoral research position with <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/phamb-1.192363"> Dr. Tomas Roslin</a> 
  at the University of Helsinki (HU) in Finland. During my postdoc at HU, I developed a individual-based together with colleagues model to predict how pollination unfolds in a spatial context and how landscape structure and network structure interact to influence pollination.

  Outside of research, I like to do outdoor activities depending on the season. I love going to saunas and taking icy swims afterwards.
