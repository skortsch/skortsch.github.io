  I am a marine community and food web ecologist currently working as a University researcher at University of Helsinki in Finland. 
    In my current position, I am working on biodiversity changes and carbon cycling in coastal food webs in the Baltic Sea. I am mentoring two PhD students (Lucinda Kraufvelin and Patrik Ståhl) in food web analyses and bioenergtic food web modelling.

  During my PhD, I was working with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raul-Primicerio"> Dr. Raul Primicerio </a>  at UiT the Arctic University of Norway, where I was introduced to food web ecology and network analyses. In my PhD, I studied variation in marine food web structure along large-scale environmental gradients in the Barents Sea (sub-Arctic to Arctic region), with special emphasis on how biological responses to climate warming (e.g., poleward shifts) change food web structure and functioning. Further, I studied benthic community responses (regime shifts) to climate warming in Svalbard.
     After my PhD I completed postdoctoral work with <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Dr. Marie Nordström </a> (Åbo Akademi, Finland). This work included linking temporal food web structure in the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Riga) to ecosystem functioning using bioenergtic food web modelling. I recently completed my second postdoctoral research position with <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/phamb-1.192363"> Dr. Tomas Roslin</a> 
  at the University of Helsinki (HU) in Finland. During my postdoc at HU, I developed a individual-based model to predict how pollination unfolds in a spatial context and how landscape structure and network structure interact to influence pollination.

  Outside of research, I like to do outdoor activities depending on the season. I also love going to saunas and taking icy swims afterwards.
