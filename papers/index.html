In this paper, we test whether species' motif participation is related to persistence in simulated networks. We find that motif participation is related to extinction risk in ways that are not entirely explained by degree and trophic level, suggesting that it may be worthwhile adding motifs to the extinction prediction toolbox.

We combine a multi-decade series of High Arctic plant-pollinator networks with single-visit deposition data to estimate pollination service to a key plant. Despite earlier predictions of declining insect populations, we find no directional trend in pollination service. This suggests that the effects of climate change on the High Arctic may be more variable across habitat types and taxonomic groups than commonly suggested.

Understanding the full diet of natural enemies is necessary for evaluating their role as biocontrol agents, because many enemy species do not only feed on pests but also on other natural enemies. Such intraguild predation can compromise pest control if the consumed enemies are actually better for pest control than their predators. In this study, we used gut metabarcoding to quantify diets of all common arachnid species in Swedish and Spanish apple orchards. Results suggest that most arachnids consume a large range of putative pest species on apple but also a high proportion of other natural enemies. There was also a tendency for cursorial spiders to have more intraguild prey in the gut than web spiders. Two groups that may be overlooked as important biocontrol agents in apple orchards seem to be theridiid web spiders and opilionids, where the latter had several small-bodied pest species in the gut.

DNA metabarcoding of faeces or gut contents has greatly increased our ability to construct networks of predators and prey (food webs) by reducing the need to observe predation events directly. The possibility of both false positives and false negatives in DNA sequences, however, means that constructing food networks using DNA requires researchers to make many choices as to which DNA sequences indicate true prey for a particular predator. As an alternative to arbitrary fixed thresholds, we demonstrate how to construct food networks using a simple Bayesian model to suggest which sequences correspond to true prey. The networks obtained using a well-chosen fixed cutoff and our Bayesian approach are very similar, especially when links are resolved to prey families rather than species. We therefore recommend that researchers reconstruct diet data using a Bayesian approach with well-specified assumptions rather than continuing with arbitrary fixed cutoffs.

In this paper, we test whether more closely-related plants tend to share more pollinators or herbivores, and whether the strength of this trend varies between families and communities. Although there was substantial variation, we did find that interaction partners are generally phylogenetically conserved. Differences between families suggest that different selective pressures might be at work in, for example, Asteraceae and Ranunculaceae.

This paper examines how spatial turnover in marine fish community composition affects the structure of the fish food web. We found that the network was generally highly connected and did not show strong spatial modules, but the expected increase in species richness towards the tropics did result in changes to network structure. The high spatial connectivity may help marine food webs to resist perturbations, but could also allow the effects of disturbances to spread rapidly.

This paper begins by describing the nested layers of uncertainty which affect the assembly of empirical ecological networks (e.g., due to true variation in interactions between sites, variation in interactions due to changes in abundances, or variation in the detectability of different interactions). To address the uncertainty inherent in empirical networks, we propose a simple and adaptable Bayesian framework. Using this framework makes the assumptions used to build the network explicit and can account for different levels of information about different interactions.

This paper explores how links' roles (e.g., centrality, proportion of predator's diet contributed, and prey abundance) and host taxonomies relate to their use as parasite transmission routes. Host taxonomy plays a major role, as most parasites are restricted to small numbers of hosts. After taking host taxonomy into account, we found that transmission routes generally involved intermediate prey with high local biomasses, while links between intermediate and definitive hosts tend to be dynamically weak.

This contrasts with earlier work which has found strong effects of species-level diets on species-level parasite loads.

Most ecological networks treat interactions as fixed entities, which occur or do not occur. Interaction strengths or frequencies may be included, but these are also usually treated as fixed values. This ignores the variability of interactions between species over space and time as community composition, species traits, and local conditions change. This paper introduces probabilistic equivalents for many commonly-used network metrics and advocates for a more realistic consideration of the variability in interactions in the future.

This paper introduces software and an analysis pipeline designed to collect and combine data from disparate sources into predicted food webs. These webs can then be used as first steps towards understanding areas where food webs have not yet been constructed, or to compare observed food webs with those expected based on species occurrances and ecological rules. The ever-increasing volume of open ecological data means that such approaches have great potential to augment the time- and resource-intensive construction of ecological networks for each site of interest.

In this paper, we combine a classic island-biogeography dataset with a more recently-constructed food web for the community in order to test whether information about species' trophic links can improve our predictions of community turnover. This work draws upon the Trophic Theory of Island Biogeography (TTIB), which aims to refine the classic Theory of Island Biogeography by incorporating the dependence of predators upon their prey. Consistent with the TTIB, we found that the presence of prey did affect species' probabilities of extinction on small islands. We did not detect and effect of predators, but note that predators were nearly omnipresent in this dataset.

In this thesis, I explored several aspects of species' and links' roles in ecological networks. All chapters except one have since been published, and the remaining chapter is currently in preparation. Please check out the individual articles that interest you.

The latitudinal gradient in species richness is well known but poorly understood. One possible explanation for this widespread trend is that species tend to be more specialised in the tropics, leading to smaller niches and allowing greater numbers of species to coexist. Specialisation, however, also depends directly upon species richness. In this paper, we test whether the scaling of specialisation with species richness varies over latitude in different ecosystem types (marine, freshwater, or terrestrial). We found that, in freshwater food webs, the scaling of specialisation with species richness did vary over latitude. In other ecosystem types, however, there was no trend. This suggests that the latitudinal diversity gradient may have different drivers in different types of ecosystems.

Parasites are involved in several different types of interactions: parasitism, predation by free-living species on free-living parasite life stages, intraguild predation among parasites, and concomitant predation on parasites inside their hosts. We tested how adding these different types of interactions affects how we see the roles of parasites and free-living species in food webs, and how the roles of different types of links compared. Concomitant predation is the only interaction type which clearly distinguishes the roles of parasites from those of free-living species. The roles of concomitant predation links are, however, much more variable than those of other interaction types.

In this paper, we used paired pollination networks including and excluding exotic plants to determine how these species may affect network structure. We found that vulnerable pollinators appear to depend strongly upon exotic plants, suggesting that removing exotic species may place some pollinators at greater risk of extinction. This is not to say that exotic plants are, in general, beneficial to native communities, but that they may be useful when attempting to conserve particular pollinator species.
