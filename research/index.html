  <p> My work revolves around two main broad research topics: 1) linking ecological network structure to ecosystem functioning, and recently also to stability, and 2) studying how ecological networks vary through time and space in response to environmental variability and perturbations from climate change. </p>
    Most of the systems I study are marine, including the Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean, but I recently I ventured out into the fascinating world of plant-pollinator interactions adding a new study system to my repertoire.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Effects of marine heatwaves on food web structure and functioning </H4> 
    Together with group from Åbo Akademi, <a href="http://pansch-research.com/?page_id=743/"> Lucinda Kraufevlin </a>, <a href="http://pansch-research.com/"> Christian Pansch </a> and <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Marie Nordstöm </a>, I am performing bioenergetic food web modelling using community data from previous mesocosm experiments. The mesocosm communities were subjected to marine heatwaves. The idea is to analyse how food web structure and function changes when heatwaves hit coastal Baltic Sea communties. The analyses will be part of LKs PhD thesis.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Effects of landscape structure and pollinator specialisation to pollination </H4> 
    In my recent postdoctoral project at the University of Helsinki (2020-2022), I studied how landscape configurations and network structure interact to infuence plant-pollinator encounter rates with consequences for the pollination process, using an individual-based modeling approach. This work was done in collaboration with colleagues from Helsinki University (Tomas Roslin, <a href="https://cirtwill.github.io/"> Alyssa Cirtwill</a> and Giovanni Strona). Outside of HU, Tom Timberlake, Jane Memmott, Liam Kendall and Leoanrdo Saravia contributed to the work.

    I am currently involved in an international food web project with Argententian colleagues <a href="https://lsaravia.github.io/"> Dr. Leonardo Saravia </a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas-Marina"> Dr. Tomas Marina </a> from <b> Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas </b> that aims to assess the anthropogenic effects and environmental variability in food web structure along a latitudinal gradient from the Atlantic to Southwest-Antarctica
