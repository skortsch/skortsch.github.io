  <p> My work revolves around two main broad research topics: 1) linking ecological network structure (food webs) to ecosystem functioning, and recently also to stability, and 2) studying how ecological networks vary through time and space in response to environmental variability and perturbations from, in particular, climate change. </p>
    Most of the systems I study are marine (coastal and offshore), including the Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean, but recently I entered the fascinating world of plant-pollinator interactions adding a new study system to my repertoire.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Effects of marine heatwaves on coastal marine food web structure and functioning </H4> 
    Together with group from Åbo Akademi, <a href="http://pansch-research.com/?page_id=743/"> Lucinda Kraufevlin </a>, <a href="http://pansch-research.com/"> Christian Pansch </a> and <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Marie Nordstöm </a>, I am analysing community data from mesocosm experiments which have been exposed to marine heatwaves. The idea is to analyse how food web structure and functions changes when heatwaves hit coastal Baltic Sea communties. To analyse the quatitative changes in food web structure and relate this to changes in eneergfy fluxes, we will use bioenergetic food web modeling. Some of the analyses will be part of Lucinda's PhD thesis.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> The Gulf of Riga food web </H4> 
    Together with Patrick Ståhl (PhD stud.) and <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Marie Nordstöm </a> from ÅAU, I am investigating how unweighted and weighted food web modularity and robustness varies over time. The analyses will be part of Patrick's PhD thesis. Further, I am investigating the relative importance of biotic and abitoic drivers for structering the GoR food web using structural equation modeling. The GoR food web has also been used as a case study system in other projects together with one of my main collaboraters <a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lai-Zhang-2> Dr. Lai Zhang </a> from Yangzhou University in China. In these project the GoR food web was used to better understand the relationship between food web structure and function varibaility, and the role of generality (number of resource items) in shaping food web robustness.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Effects of landscape structure and pollinator specialisation on pollination </H4> 
    In my recent postdoctoral project at the University of Helsinki (2020-2022), I studied how landscape configurations and network structure interact to infuence plant-pollinator encounter rates with consequences for the pollination process, using an individual-based modeling approach. This work was done in collaboration with colleagues from Helsinki University (Tomas Roslin, <a href="https://cirtwill.github.io/"> Alyssa Cirtwill</a> and Giovanni Strona). Outside of HU, Tom Timberlake, Jane Memmott, Liam Kendall and Leonardo Saravia contributed to the work.

    <div class="col-md-4"><H4> Food web variability along environmental gradients from the Atlantic to the Antarctic </H4> 
    I am currently involved in an international food web project with Argentinian colleagues <a href="https://lsaravia.github.io/"> Dr. Leonardo Saravia </a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas-Marina"> Dr. Tomas Marina </a> from <b> Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas </b>. The projects aims at assessing the anthropogenic effects and environmental variability in food web structure along a latitudinal gradient from the Atlantic to Southwest-Antarctic.
