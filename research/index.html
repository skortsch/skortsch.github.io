<H3> General </H3> </p>
  
  <p> Hi, I am community ecologist, mostly working on marine communties and food webs, but recently also ventured into the fascinating world of plant-pollinator interactions 
    My work revolves around two main topics: 
     <br>
    1) linking ecological network structure to ecosystem functioning (and recently stability), and 
     <br>
    2) studying how ecological networks vary through time and space in response to environmental variability and perturbations from e.g., climate change. </p>

    Together with Lucinda Kraufevlin, Christian Pansch and Marie Nordst√∂m, I am performing bioenergetic food web modelling using data from mesocosm communities with data retrieved from previous mesocosm experiments. The analyses will be part of LKs PhD thesis.

    In my postdoctoral project at the University of Helsinki (2020-2022), I studied how landscape configurations and network structure interact to infuence plant-pollinator encounter rates with consequences for the pollination process, using an individual-based modeling approach

    I am currently involved in a project that aims to assess the anthropogenic effects and environmental variability in food web structure along a latitudinal gradient from the Atlantic to Southwest-Antarctica?
