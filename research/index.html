    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Baltic shoreline food webs </H4> <br>
      The shoreline of the Baltic Sea provides an excellent natural laboratory to test how changes in the marine environment affect terrestrial species. Using wolf spiders (the top predator among shoreline arthropods) as a focal species, I am investigating how changes in the amount and type of resources provided by the marine environment affect the terrestrial food web.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Baltic Sea food webs</H4> <br>
      The Baltic Sea is ecologically and economically important to all of the countries that border it. The human uses for the Baltic impose a number of different pressures that threaten other species, the communities they make up, and the services we provide. I am involved in several projects aiming to better understand the structure of the Baltic marine food web. Research questions under this umbrella include how the Baltic food web varies spatially and with respect to environmental variables, and how the food web will mediate the effects of different threats on ecosystem services.

    <div class="col-md-4"><H4>Traits, roles, and ecosystem services </H4> <br>
    There is a substantial literature surrounding the ways in which species' traits influence their interactions. For example, predators are generally larger than their prey and plants can only be pollinated by compatible animals. It is less well understood, however, how the effects of traits on these pairwise interactions scale up to shape species' roles within networks or their contributions to ecosystem services. I am involved in several projects tackling different ways in which traits, roles, and ecosystem services are interconnected. Some of these projects use the Baltic Sea as a case study, but this work touches on many different study systems.
