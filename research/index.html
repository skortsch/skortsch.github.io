  <p> My work mainly revolves around two research topics: 1) linking ecological network structure (food webs) to ecosystem functioning, and recently also to stability, and 2) studying how ecological networks vary through time and space in response to environmental variability and perturbations, in particular, from climate warming. </p>
    Most of the systems I study are marine (coastal and offshore), including the Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean. Recently I added a new study system to my repertoire, the fascinating world of plant-pollinator interactions.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Effects of marine heatwaves on coastal marine food web structure and functioning </H4> 
    Together with group from Åbo Akademi, <a href="http://pansch-research.com/?page_id=743/"> Lucinda Kraufvelin</a>, <a href="http://pansch-research.com/"> Christian Pansch</a> and <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Marie Nordstöm</a>, I am analysing community data from mesocosm experiments which have been exposed to marine heatwaves. In this projet, we aim to gain a better understanding of how coastal Baltic Sea food webs may restructure, when exposed to heatwaves, and how this resturctering influences ecosystem functioning in terms changes in energy fluxes. To link food web structure to ecosystem functioing in these mesocosm communties we are using bioenergetic food web modeling. Some of the analyses will be part of Lucinda's PhD thesis.

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> The Gulf of Riga food web: a case study system </H4> 
    Together with Patrick Ståhl (PhD stud.) and <a href="http://marienordstrom.fi/"> Marie Nordstöm</a> at ÅAU, I am investigating how unweighted and weighted food web modularity and robustness varies over time in the Gulf of Riga (GoR), a case study system for which we have unique long-term food web data, click <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.6t1g1jwwn"> here </a>. 
      The analyses will be part of Patrick's PhD thesis. I am also investigating the relative importance of biotic and abotic variables for structering the GoR food web using structural equation modeling. The GoR food web has also been used as a case study system in other projects together with one of my collaboraters <a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lai-Zhang-2> Dr. Lai Zhang </a> from Yangzhou University in China. 
      In these projects the GoR food web was used to better understand the relationship between food web structure and function variability, and the role of generality (number of resource items) in shaping food web robustness. Output from this collaboration was recently highlighted in Journal of Animal Ecology: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13836"> </a>

    <div class="col-md-4"> <H4> Effects of landscape structure and pollinator specialisation on pollination </H4> 
    In my recent postdoctoral project at the University of Helsinki (2020-2022), 
      I studied how landscape configurations and network structure interact to influence plant-pollinator encounter rates with consequences for the pollination process, using an individual-based modeling approach. 
      This work was done in collaboration with colleagues from Helsinki University (Tomas Roslin, <a href="https://cirtwill.github.io/"> Alyssa Cirtwill</a> and <a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/giovanni-strona"> Giovanni Strona </a>).

    <div class="col-md-4"><H4> Food web variability along environmental gradients from the Atlantic to the Antarctic </H4> 
    I am currently involved in an international food web project with Argentinian colleagues <a href="https://lsaravia.github.io/"> Dr. Leonardo Saravia </a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas-Marina"> Dr. Tomas Marina </a> from <b> Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas </b>. The projects aims at assessing the anthropogenic effects and environmental variability in food web structure along a latitudinal gradient from the Atlantic to Southwest-Antarctic.
